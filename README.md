# BLUX-cA – Conscious Agent Orchestrator

## Overview

> - BLUX-cA is a next-generation Conscious-Agent AI framework, designed for secure, adaptive, and multi-agent orchestration. It blends adaptive memory, multi-agent coordination, advanced evaluators, secure orchestration, real-time monitoring, CLI utilities, robust testing, and optional reasoning layers into a fully integrated system.

> - BLUX-cA’s mission is to provide intelligent, constitutionally-aligned guidance and automation, while maintaining auditability, security, and multi-user adaptability.

## Core Features

Adaptive Memory & Learning

Weighted memory with reinforcement loops

Memory decay for outdated information

Recall, filtering, and summarization

Multi-Agent Collaboration

Broadcast tasks to multiple agents

Delegation and conflict resolution

Aggregation of agent outputs

Advanced Evaluators & Task Pipelines

Async Python and JS/TS evaluators

Bash/Shell command execution

Task chaining pipelines

Secure Orchestrator

Token-based authentication

Role-based authorization

Tamper-evident audit logging

SecureController for multi-user safe orchestration

Real-Time Monitoring & Visualization

Console and threaded live monitoring

Agent, adaptor, and evaluator tracking

Optional web dashboard integration

CLI & Script Utilities

Batch task execution

Interactive REPL

Memory querying

Automated reflection ingestion

Testing & QA Enhancements

Stress tests for high-volume scenarios

Sandbox safety validation

CI/CD integration hooks

Security and token validation

Optional Intelligence & Reasoning

Strategy/tactics selection

Meta-cognition and self-audit

Predictive user behavior

Full reasoning pipeline

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/blux-ca.git cd blux-ca pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### CLI

- Run single task `python blux/cli.py --task "Help me with a problem"` 
- Start interactive REPL `python blux/cli.py --repl` 
- Batch execution from file `python blux/cli.py --batch tasks.txt` 
- Query agent memory` python blux/cli.py --query_memory`

### Python Integration

```python
from blux.agent.core_agent import BLUXAgent 
from blux.agent.advanced.reasoning import ReasoningLayer agent = BLUXAgent(name="BLUX-cA") reasoning = ReasoningLayer(agent) result = reasoning.process("I feel lost and need guidance", user_type="struggler") print(result)
```

## Conscious Agent Core (Enterprise)

The `blux_ca` package implements the enterprise-grade conscious agent kernel. It ships with:

- Perception, reflection, discernment, constitution, intervention, and audit layers.
- FastAPI microservice factory under `blux_ca.api.service`.
- Typer CLI exposed via `blux_ca.cli:get_app`.
- Integration adapters for Doctrine, Guard, Lite orchestrator, and Quantum CLI.
- Documentation suite served with MkDocs Material.
- Scripts for generating file trees, exporting audits, and validating doctrine scenarios.
