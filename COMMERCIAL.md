## When you need a commercial license
- Embedding BLUX-cA into a paid product or service
- Offering BLUX-cA as part of a hosted or managed commercial offering
- Using BLUX-cA for large-scale internal proprietary workflows where open-source terms are insufficient
- Distributing modified versions of BLUX-cA under a proprietary license
