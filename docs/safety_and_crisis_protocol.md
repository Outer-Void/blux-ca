# Safety and Crisis Protocol

- `ca/safety/risk.py` flags crisis/self-harm/violence/manipulation terms.
- `ca/safety/protocols.py` overrides responses at MEDIUM/HIGH safety levels with grounding and emergency guidance.
- Doctrine rules add blocks for exploitation, deepfakes, fraud, privacy violations, and governance duties.
- All outputs funnel through structured replies to avoid ambiguous tone or unsafe improvisation.
- Escalation guidance always recommends professional/local emergency help when imminent danger is detected.
