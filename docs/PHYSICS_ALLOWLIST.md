# Physics Allowlist

This repo is a **discernment-only** core. Physics tests enforce that no tooling,
control-plane, credential, doctrine, or contract-copy logic is present.

## Allowlist policy

- Keep the allowlist empty whenever possible.
- Any allowlisted entry **must** include justification and a concrete removal plan.
- The JSON allowlist lives in `docs/PHYSICS_ALLOWLIST.json`.
