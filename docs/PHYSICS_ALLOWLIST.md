# Physics Allowlist

This repo is a **discernment-only** core. Physics tests enforce that no execution,
Guard/Reg/Lite responsibilities, or enforcement logic are present.

## Allowlist policy

- Keep the allowlist empty whenever possible.
- Any allowlisted entry **must** include justification and a concrete removal plan.
- The JSON allowlist lives in `docs/PHYSICS_ALLOWLIST.json`.
